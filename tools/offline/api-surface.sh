# Prints the server-API method references the compiled code emits, with full JVM descriptors.
#
# Exists because a compile-only stub whose signature differs from the real one compiles perfectly
# and then throws NoSuchMethodError on a live server: the return type is part of the descriptor,
# so `Component append(ComponentLike)` and `Component append(Component)` are two different methods
# as far as the JVM is concerned, and only one of them exists.
#
# References are read out of the constant pool (javap -v) rather than the disassembly, because
# javap omits the owner for calls to the current class - and inherited calls like getDataFolder()
# look exactly like that, which is precisely where a wrong stub would hide.
#
# Two checks use this:
#   * the self-test compares the default output against the recorded api-surface.txt, which
#     catches an edited stub without needing the network;
#   * CI compares --all output of the offline build against the same sources built against the
#     real paper-api. That is what ties the stubs to reality; it needs both builds to use the
#     same JDK, otherwise javac version differences show up as noise.
#
# Usage: api-surface.sh <classes-dir> [--all]
#
#   default  server-supplied owners only (org/bukkit, io/papermc, net/kyori, com/destroystokyo)
#   --all    every method reference, for the offline-versus-real-API diff in CI
